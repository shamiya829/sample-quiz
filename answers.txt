The three major financial statements are the Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement which provide information on a company's revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities, equity, and cash flow.
The Income Statement shows revenue, expenses, and net income; the Balance Sheet shows assets, liabilities, and equity; and the Cash Flow Statement shows the sources and uses of cash from operating, investing, and financing activities.
Net Income adds to Cash Flow, adjusted for Balance Sheet changes. Investing & financing activities yield the net change in cash; Assets = Liabilities + Equity.
The Cash Flow Statement shows a company's actual cash generation, unlike the Income Statement which may be misleading, making it crucial for analysis.
The Income Statement and Balance Sheet can be used to create the Cash Flow Statement, making them important financial statements for analysis.
