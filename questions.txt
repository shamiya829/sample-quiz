Walk me through the 3 financial statements.
Can you give examples of major line items on each of the financial statements?
How do the 3 statements link together? 
If I were stranded on a desert island, only had 1 statement and I wanted to review the overall health of a company – which statement would I use and why? 
Let’s say I could only look at 2 statements to assess a company’s prospects – which 2 would I use and why?
